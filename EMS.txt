Clusters:
A cluster could be used for tables storing employee information and department information that are frequently accessed together.

Tables:
A table is a database object that stores data in rows and columns. Each table is defined by its schema, which specifies the columns, data types, and constraints (e.g., primary keys).

Status : Stores the different statuses that can be assigned to various entities in the system (e.g., active, inactive).
Project_Role : Contains roles assigned to employees within projects.
Project_Status : Stores the statuses of projects (e.g., not started, in progress, completed).
Attendance_Status : Defines the status of employee attendance (e.g., present, absent, late).
Technology : Lists technologies used or available in the system.
Designations : Stores employee designations or job titles.
Employees : Contains details about employees.
Locations : Stores information about different locations (e.g., office locations).
Departments : Contains details of different departments within the organization.
Projects : Stores details of projects.
Employee_Project_Assignments : Tracks the assignments of employees to projects.
Attendance :  Records employee attendance.
Leaves : Tracks leave requests and statuses.
Training_Programs : Lists training programs available for employees.
Salaries : Maintains salary information for employees.


Indexes:
Indexes improve the performance of database queries. Each index is created on one or more columns of a table to speed up data retrieval.

Sequences:
Sequences generate unique numeric values, often used for primary key columns

Packages:
Packages group related PL/SQL procedures, functions, variables, and cursors into a single unit.

Procedures:
Stored procedures are precompiled PL/SQL code blocks that perform specific tasks or operations.

Functions:
Functions are PL/SQL blocks that return a value and can be used in SQL statements.

Views:
Views are virtual tables created by querying one or more tables. They can simplify complex queries and present data in a specific format.

Triggers:
Triggers are PL/SQL code blocks that automatically execute in response to certain events on a table (e.g., insert, update, delete).
